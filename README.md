# Bird-Strike-Analysis

## About this Project

**1.Introduction:**

**1.1 Introduction to the project**

A bird Strike can be defined as a collision between a bird species and the aircraft engine . A bird
strike can result in various mishaps such as crash landing of aircraft or an aircraft getting stalled
which may lead to some unavoidable circumstantial landing situations. In order to prevent such
mishaps from happening in the near future we propose an idea of predicting future bird strikes
and analysis of the previous years data of bird strikes. The data of the previous years will be
analysed and will help in improving the accuracy of prediction of bird strikes that might occur
over the period of next five years. The prediction and analysis would be based on the parameters
such as phase of flight, period of the day or altitude. Numerous other parameters like bird species
and size of bird species can also be analysed through which there can be a pattern established
which will not only help us understand the birdsâ€™ migration route but also help prevent any bird
strikes in future. The prevention of bird strikes through prior prediction can save a lot of lives
that might be at stake. The algorithms that can be used for prediction would be linear regression,
random forest algorithm and time series analysis.

**1.2 Motivation**

Motivation for any project is not just needed by a single team member. It is a joint effort which
has to be taken by each member of a project team. Similarly in our project, each of the team
members wanted to give something back to the society and we all collectively decided that civil
aviation is an industry which is booming a lot in current times, however it also needs
advancements in the direction of bird strike prevention as it is type of incident that needs
constant attention, since it not only compromises the aircraft safety but also leads to loss of
wildlife.

**1.3 Problem Definition**

The aim of our project is to analyze past years bird strike data with respect to phase of flight,
time of day, pilot warning status and various other parameters.The model will make predictions
about the occurrence of bird strikes in future years in order to make important decisions to avoid
future occurrences of bird strikes.

**1.4 Relevance of the project**

For the aviation industry, aircraft and passenger safety is of utmost importance. Bird strikes pose
a threat to the same. Therefore, a system that predicts the occurrence of these bird strikes and

analyses the parameters that affect their occurrence would be of great assistance to the aviation
industry in preventing future bird strikes, thereby increasing flight safety.

**1.5 Methodology used:**

The main objective of the methodology applied is to analyze the Bird Strike data obtained from
Kaggle by a Data Scientist at Travelport Atlanta, Georgia, United States and use it for the
betterment of passengers as our vision is to make the Air traffic controllers aware of the
advancement in technology which can benefit them in not only increasing the rate of avoiding
bird strike occurrences but also give them the opportunity to increase the probity among the
community of passengers and airlines . The databases for both the survey results have been
provided for further study. It aims to take crucial decisions in the aviation industry related to the
flight plans.
